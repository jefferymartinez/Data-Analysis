# Data-Analysis
CS 1030-007 Final
I am using the 2023 MLB prediction data. One of my questions about the data is when a team's starting pitcher is pitching (or has a higher rating) do they win more games when he is pitching. Does the higher elo pitcher win more games when facing a lower elo pitcher?

After looking through all of the data, I have noticed that when the higher elo (the higher the elo of the pitcher, the better the pitcher is) pitcher is pitching that team has a higher probability of winning the game. Now with my background in baseball, this seems to make sense because when the team that has their better pitcher pitching, they are more than likely to win the game. Something else that I noticed was that the lower elo pitcher would more than likely give up more runs scored. This is due to the “poor” pitching of that specific person. One trend that I noticed was that when the rating of elo was similar the score of the games were within 1-2 runs. This is because the pitchers were pretty evenly matched which leads to really good baseball games. Not scores of 10-2 but scores of 4-5. 

Data Tools:
When I was going through the data tools, I learned about CSV files. CSV files are a single file stored with data but it is a limited size so it doesn’t take up as much space on the hard drive. In order to access the data, we have to open the file and copy and paste it to a spreadsheet so that we can see what we are working with. Once we see all of the data, we can finally analyze it to help with what the objective is. 

Big Data:
When going through the big data module, I learned how big data sets can actually be. There is a report that estimates the total size of digital data will be 175 zettabytes in 2025. A zettabyte is a trillion gigabytes… Obviously a very big data set is going to take time to process, so it is essential to keep that in mind. Something that is very interesting is that large data sets are usually always related to people so we have to make sure that we are being very responsible with what we are doing with the data. 

Bias in Machine Learning:
When talking about machine learning, there are three general approaches to it. Reinforcement learning, unsupervised machine learning and supervised machine learning. Reinforcement learning is where the algorithm performs actions that will be rewarded, UML is finding patterns in unlabeled data, and SML is analyzing labeled data. 

Unit Test:
When I was doing the unit test, I noticed that a lot of the questions were looking at graphs, or a section of spreadsheets and asking questions like what can you conclude from these points on the graph. Or, what can the people reading the row understand from this spreadsheet? I find it to be interesting because you can see the answer in front of your face if you look hard enough.
